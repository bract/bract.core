# bract.core

Bract is a multi-purpose, modular Clojure application initialization framework.

The _bract.core_ module implements the essential functionality and is a common dependency for all modules.

**Early days. Expect breaking changes!**

_**Requires Clojure 1.7 or higher, Java 7 or higher.**_


## Rationale

Application development could be a wonderful experience if we only have to focus on the application logic without
worrying about configuration, initialization and the sundry development/maintenance tasks that applications frequently
need. This should be a solved problem.


### What is Bract?

Bract aims to bind the following pieces together:

- Application entry-point
- Application configuration
- Steps to initialize and launch application
- Extensions to _bract.core_ via Bract modules
- Integration with libraries/frameworks via Bract modules

Bract does not aim to:

- Prescribe what environments (Dev/QA/Prod etc.) you may have
- Decide which libraries you should use (except Keypin for configuration)
- Make you use dependency injection, let alone any particular DI library
- Discourage you from using dependency injection


[Keypin](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/keypin) is the only _bract.core_ dependency for config support. While
_bract.core_ is low level and prescribes no style, it is possible to author opinionated Bract modules on top of it.
One may even extend Bract to build a custom application framework. Bract is suited for various types of applications,
e.g. command-line tools, web services, batch jobs, web applications etc. and integrates well with tangential, yet
relevant aspects such as configurable JVM logging.


## Usage

Leiningen coordinates: `[bract/bract.core "0.3.0"]`
